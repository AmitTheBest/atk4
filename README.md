Overview
----
Agile Toolkit has introduced three new principles in web development:

 * A Complete UI solution for PHP developers
 * Unique integration between jQuery events and chains and PHP
 * Innovative Object Relational Manager with support for joins, sub-selects and expression abstraction.

All the features are delivered in a unique close-coupled environment - Similarly to Cocoa or Qt - all objects of Agile Toolkit are based off one common ancestor and are constructed under the guidance of the top-level Application object.

Installing
----
To start a new web application in Agile Toolkit, download a bundle from http://agiletoolkit.org/ and follow instructions.
Alternatively, if you are a very hardcore developer, add the following code inside your `composer.json` file:

    "require": {
        "atk4/atk4": "4.3.*@dev"
    }
