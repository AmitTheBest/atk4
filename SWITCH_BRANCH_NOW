Hi there, Agile Toolkit User


Our "master" branch is transitioning from 4.2 to 4.3 version.


Because I don't want to confuse you, I have temporarily left
"master" branch in this VOID space. Now you can decide which version
of Agile Toolkit you are willing to use.

1. If you are willing to use 4.2, then switch to branch "4.2":

  git fetch --all
  git checkout 4.2

2. If you want to work on a new project using 4.3 version, visit

  http://www4.agiletoolkit.org/

and download package from there. (there is also 4.3 branch)
