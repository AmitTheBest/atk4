Class Page have one interesting functionality. If you define a tag called "frame_this" inside
your page's template, the whole content of a page will be put into a frame (defined in template
"frame").  Here is a page sample:

<?content?>
<?frame_this?>Frame Title<?/frame_this?>
Content of the frame
<?/content?>


You should keep frame_this inside "content", because only "content" is cloned.
