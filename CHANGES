AModules3 beta2 comes with some changes to the libraries and if you are
switching from earlier version, you should read this section carefully.


==[ ApiAdmin ]==
I have decided to create more initialization functions. Now you don't
have to initialize completely everything inside function init(), and
I have introduced initialization order you should follow.

 First you should initialize the Page. If your page relies on
 some sort of frameworks those should be loaded on demand.

 After page is initialized, you shoud try to insert additional
 elements to the page such as menues, advertisements etc. Basic
 actions don't need that stuff initialized

Page initialization sequence:

 Sometimes on the page you want to have filters, dialogs listers,
 paginators. There are some rules on initialization sequence:

  - initialize forms first.
  - initialize lister
  - initialize filters and paginators, give lister to them as
     reference and they will be able to adjust the query.

LAYOUT
 ApiAdmin::__construct now takes 2nd argumen which is layout. After giving
 it some thought I decided that layout shouldn't be configurable, 
 layouts are quite flexible anyway - one layout can have menu, other
 can live without. If your application is designed for particular layout
 it should be changed by developer only.

 kt2: is a new layout which is used by default. It's developed as a
 clean, nice, css/ajax friendly layout. I'll try to patch up am3
 to follow the changes and so that it is also usable.
